Mood sniffer
============

Uses a keylogger to sniff emotions (smileys, for example) and procrastination (typing facebook for example) and publishes them to a backend service for playback or datamining, also includes a topmost window sniffer which reports which app is used for how long, and how many keystrokes was used in that app.
